# LAPD plasma analysis repository
### Description
This repository holds Python code for analyzing plasma physics experiment data. It reads and processes Langmuir probe, Mach probe, and interferometer data from HDF5 files generated by experiments at UCLA's Large Plasma Device (LAPD).
### Managed by
This GitHub page is managed by Leo Murphy and Michael Campagna as part of a research project under Prof. Saskia Mordijck for William & Mary plasma physics.
### Use
Download all Python files. Download desired HDF5 files and note their file paths. Change necessary parameters inside main.py before running. Make sure plasmapy, bottleneck, PyQt5, and bapsflib are installed. This code was written in Python 3.11.
