def make_characteristic_array(bias, current, ramp_bounds):
    """
    Process bias and current data into an array of Characteristic objects, each representing one sweep curve.
    The resulting array is 3D, with dimensions: unique (x, y) position, shot, ramp.
    Takes in a bias and a current array, selects each ramp, and creates a Characteristic object
    for each ramp at each unique x,y position.
    Later concatenated with 3D arrays from other isweeps (other sources of sweep current, e.g.
    faces on a Langmuir probe) to make a larger 4D array to pass to diagnostics.py.
        - Note: a "ramp" is a series of frames in which a Langmuir probe voltage sweep is performed.
          It is called a "ramp" because the applied voltage, instead of remaining at the typical large negative value,
          increases steadily to a large positive value (ramp), then rapidly drops back to negative (quench).
          (WIP explain better # todo)

    Parameters
    ----------
    bias : `astropy.units.Quantity`
        3D array with units of voltage, representing Langmuir probe voltage over time, with dimensions of
        position, shot, and frame (within a sweep).
    current : `astropy.units.Quantity`
        3D array with units of current, representing Langmuir probe voltage over time, with dimensions of
         position, shot, and frame (within a sweep).
    ramp_bounds : `numpy.ndarray` of `int`
        2D array of shape (number of ramps, 2). Ramp start indices are in the first column; end indices in the second.
        Calculated by the `isolate_ramps` function.

    Returns
    -------
    `numpy.ndarray` of `plasmapy.diagnostics.langmuir.Characteristic`
        3D array of Characteristic objects with location, shot, and ramp number dimensions.
