This folder, lapd-plasma-analysis/replacement-files/, contains two .py files which should replace the files of the same name
in the plasmapy module.

Make sure plasmapy is installed. Navigate to the module folder.

langmuir.py should overwrite langmuir.py, found in plasmapy/diagnostics/.

frequencies.py should overwrite frequencies.py, found in plasmapy/formulary/collisions/.
